<h2>Introducing Archimate</h2>
<br/>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>
Archimate is a modelling language and technique that is used to describe enterprise architectures. Briefly:
<ul>
	<li>It provides a simple and uniform structure to describe the contents of architecture domaines</li>
	<li>It presents with clarity the concepts and relationships within and between architecture domaines</li>
	<li>Compared to other modelling languages, Archimate
		<ul>
			<li>Provides a well defined metamodel</li>
			<li>Targets a wider enterprise modelling scope</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Archimate offers a common language for describing the construction and operation of
		<ul>
			<li>Technical infrastructures</li>
			<li>Information technology systems</li>
			<li>Information flows</li>
			<li>Organisational structures</li>
			<li><B>Business processes</B></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		Therefore it greatly helps to handle the impact of decisions and changes by allowing a clearer and more understandable design, assessment and communication abilities within and between the considered business domains
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<p>
	Archimates views the enterprise architecture as divided into a business, application and technology layers and within each domain considers the active elements (they exhibit behaviours), the internal structure and the communication elements (the elements that define, use or communicate informations)
	
</p>
<br/>
It is possible to use Archimate along with other modelling languages. For example in comparison with UML, Archimate was purposed to model enterprise architectures (all of the systems in the organisation) while UML is well suited with documenting the architecture of a single system. Thus at the enterprise level we may use Archimate to document the architecture and when we focus on a single system we may provide it's complete architecture documentation using UML feature (Which by the way provide some thirteen or more diagrams offering a great flexibility to describe various systems...one at a time)
