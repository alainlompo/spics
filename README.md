The Simple and Practical Insurance Claims [management] System

Building an enterprise application from ground zero to skyline is certainly one of the most invaluable experience a developer can go through. Come and join us therefore as we are setting up the bases for the spics project.<br/>
We are planing to use the top technologies as well as the best practices in regard to building the solution as well as managing the project. <b>Enterprise Architectures</b> as well as <b>micro services</b> are at the heart of our vision, and as we decline it into our mission we will use no less than the state of the art technologies, tools and practices to get there. All contributions are warmly welcome!
